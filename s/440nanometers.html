<div class='Slugline'>INT. Family Living room - Day - 10 years ago</div>
<div class='Action'>A grainy Lavender Blue fills the screen.</div>
<div class='Action'>A CAMERA FLASH flashes White then SLOWLY FADES INTO:</div>
<div class='Action'>A comfy living room, golden morning sun through the window. A Polaroid Camera in CHRIS (29)'s hand. The subject: EIGHT YEAR OLD CARA on a sofa. Chris, in semi-casual clothes, carefully receives the photo from the camera.</div>
<div class='Action'>DIEGETIC SOUND FADES IS MUTE AND EERIE MUSIC STARTS PLAYING.</div>
<div class='Character'>Female Doctor (O.S.)</div>
<div class='Paren'>(in sympathy)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm sorry to tell you that the cells in your eyes have developed a virus.</div>
<div class='Action'>A range of cameras and photography equipment is laid out on a shelf and a non-polaroid photo of Chris, Cara and his wife.</div>
<div class='Action'>The doctor's voice pauses.</div>
<div class='Character'>Chris (O.S.)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>What does that mean?</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris proudly shows the picture to his daughter.</div>
<div class='Character'>Female Doctor (O.S.)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Twenty seconds of incoming light will blind you.</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris puts the photo into an empty Photo Case, which he puts into his pocket.</div>
<div class='Action'>FADE TO BLACK</div>
<div class='Character'>Female DOCTOR (O.S)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>But you can keep your eyes closed to shield them.</div>
<div class='Action'>MUSIC COMES TO A HALT</div>
<div class='Action'>TEXT ON SCREEN, TYPEWRITTEN:</div>
<div class='Action'>ten years later</div>
<div class='Transition'>FADE IN:</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>2.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Slugline'>INT. FaMILY LIVING ROOM - DAY - Present day</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris sits on the sofa, the warm sun rays are gone. The Camera shelf is empty. The picture of the family has the mother cut out in defiance. </div>
<div class='Action'>His eyes are closed comfortably. From the table, he takes the Photo Case. He takes out the only photo in there, which he took ten years ago. Its caption reads 'Cara at 8'.</div>
<div class='Action'>He holds it; feels it, but struggles to recall it fully in his mind. Eighteen year old CARA calls from the kitchen, he turns his head to her:</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA (O.C.)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>What are you thinking about, dad?</div>
<div class='Action'>He turns to face back to the photo, feels it. Turns back to her.</div>
<div class='Character'>Chris</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I wish I could see my little girl.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA (O.C.)</div>
<div class='Paren'>(jokingly)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Well, I'm still here when you don't see me, and I'm hardly little anymore...</div>
<div class='Character'>ChrIS</div>
<div class='Paren'>(hiding frustration)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I know...</div>
<div class='Action'>He puts the photograph into his pocket.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>EXT. WIDE GRassy Fields - Sunny day - present day</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris and Cara walk barefoot on a path. We never get a good look at her face. She holds his hand and guides him along the path. His feet feel the grass as he treads it.</div>
<div class='Character'>Chris</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Can you feel the blades of the grass? Feels like a carpet, almost.</div>
<div class='Action'>Cara smiles silently.</div>
<div class='Character'>Chris</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I wish I could see the green texture of it.</div>
<div class='Character'>Cara</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You feel it all the better now.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>3.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>But I can't <span style='font-style: italic;'>feel</span> how far this field stretches or where this path leads, can I?</div>
<div class='Action'>She turns to him, notices his hurt.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Vision is overrated.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Paren'>(wounded)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Easy for you to say. You don't have this desire...</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Dad?</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah?</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Paren'>(soft)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You have to let it go.</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris stops. Thinks and goes on.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>And how can I do that?</div>
<div class='Action'>Now she turns her head away to think, turns back to him.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>What are you keeping your vision for?</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>To one day see you, grown-up.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Paren'>(flattered)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Oh, dad.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I don't want to live in a world where I can't see your future life. What if you'll have family and I never get to see them.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Paren'>(jokingly)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You shouldn't wait for that to happen.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>4.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Action'>Chris thinks about it.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Hold on for a second.</div>
<div class='Action'>He stops, she stops. He takes the Polaroid from his pocket, holds it for a moment, hesitating. Now hands it to Cara.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>This photo is only a faint memory. I can't even remember your face.</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Can you describe it?</div>
<div class='Character'>CarA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>It's me, I'm young, in our living room.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Paren'>(hurt)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Ten years ago today. - Can you describe your face for me?</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Well, it's my face, no make up of course back then-</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Here, let me show you.</div>
<div class='Action'>She takes his hand and puts it to her head. He feels her hair, follows it down curiously.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>My hair isn't brown anymore.</div>
<div class='Character'>ChRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You're bleaching it, I remember.</div>
<div class='Action'>Hand to her nose. He traces it.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Here's my nose.</div>
<div class='Action'>He moves his hand to her chin, feels the contours.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>And my round chin.</div>
<div class='Action'>He gently lets go of her chin.</div>
<div class='Character'>ChRIS</div>
<div class='Paren'>(heartfelt)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Thank you.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Here, take it.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>5.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Action'>She leads his hand to the photo in her other hand. He takes it, puts it back in his pocket and they walk on.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Dad I don't like to see you hurting.</div>
<div class='Character'>ChrIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>It's okay, - um - it'll, it'll be worth it.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Will it though? Always waiting?</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>What can I do? I wish to see you.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Do something about it.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Why? You're my girl, it's normal.</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah, but - I feel like I'm losing you.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Losing me?</div>
<div class='Character'>Cara</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You're living for that moment where you can see me - and that's sweet and all - but you're not here for moments where you can only hear or feel me.</div>
<div class='Action'>A pause, Chris thinks.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm - sorry. Hug?</div>
<div class='Action'>He invites her for a hug and as they hug Cara speaks softly:</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You have to let it go. It will always hold you back.</div>
<div class='Character'>CHRIS</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Let what go?</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I think you know.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>6.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Slugline'>Int. FAMILY LIVING ROOM - DAY - prESENT DAy</div>
<div class='Action'>A MELODY OF SADNESS AND RELIEF PLAYS</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris and Cara enter the room, we still only see Cara in part, illuminated by sunlight. She hands him the Polaroid camera. She poses on the sofa, where she was years ago and straightens her hair.</div>
<div class='Character'>Cara</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm ready.</div>
<div class='Action'>Chris stands up, moves towards the middle of the room. He hesitates. Takes a deep breath. But it is the right thing to do.</div>
<div class='Action'>He opens his eyes and stares at her, his eighteen-year-old daughter in front of him. He's stunned by the beauty of the moment. Her eyes, clear and bright. They signal to the camera.</div>
<div class='Action'>He frames the shot and the FLASH turns everything to white and slowly fades back away. The film comes out. He puts the camera down, then the photo to shield it from light and takes out the photo from his pocket. He takes a glance at it and in joy looks up at her.</div>
<div class='Character'>Chris</div>
<div class='Paren'>(astonished)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You've really grown up.</div>
<div class='Action'>He holds up the picture, compares it with her and his eyes become weak...</div>
<div class='Character'>CARA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I have. I will always grow older than the picture in your mind.</div>
<div class='Action'>...and everything FADES TO A GRAINY LAVENDER BLUE</div>
<div class='Action'>MUSIC CHANGES TO TRANQUIL MUSIC WITH A NOTE OF SADNESS</div>
<div class='Transition'>FADE IN:</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. Family Living Room - EARLY NIGHT - Present day</div>
<div class='Action'>The music is playing from speakers in the room. Chris lies down on the sofa, listening to it; eyes closed. Soft typewritten characters spell out the credits.</div>
<div class='Action'>Cara puts down the Polaroids on the shelf, where the cameras were. The first and last photo he ever took, his daughter, ten years apart. The last photo titled 'Chris's last photo'.</div>
