<div class='Slugline'>INT. PHOEBE'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - 2033</div>
<div class='Action'>YOUNG PHOEBE (8) lies in bed, long brown hair spread out. Korean eyes filled with tears; sad and angry at the world. </div>
<div class='Action'>No like-minded people within her reach.</div>
<div class='Action'>She gets up, wipes her eyes and goes towards her computer. Crosses her modern, elegant room and sits down to see a video.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>ON SCREEN: EXT. SANGSEUNGHAN - DAY, 2033 / PARTIALLY ANIMATED</div>
<div class='Action'>A documentary shows computer-renderings and construction videos of the city Sangseunghan.</div>
<div class='Action'>TEXT ON SCREEN: READY TO INHABIT IN 2044</div>
<div class='Action'>Six city centres aligned in a hexagon. Crystalline, prismatic and shard-like skyscrapers reflect the warmth of sunlight through glass windows.</div>
<div class='Action'>In the middle of this hexagon lies a round lake. A peninsula in the south hosts two even larger, symmetric prismatoid buildings.</div>
<div class='Action'>City and lake are divided through a naturalistic forest</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. PHOEBE'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - 2033</div>
<div class='Action'>Young Phoebe wants to live there. She turns off her computer and lies down in her bed, closing her eyes to think of something else.</div>

<div class='Action'>A glass of water is slightly shivering on the flip-down table in front of PHOEBE (22). </div>
<div class='Action'>She glances behind her to recognise the empty seat behind her. Then presses a button on the armrest to angle her seat back. She peeks outside, then succeeds leaning her seat.</div>
<div class='Action'>As she pulls her hand away she cuts her finger at the sharp armrest, she takes a look at it and begins to faint.</div>
<div class='Transition'>Fade to black</div>
<div class='Character'>Young Woman (O.S.)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Are you alright?</div>
<div class='Transition'>Fade back in</div>
<div class='Action'>The YOUNG WOMAN (24) is wrapping a pocket tissue around Phoebe's bleeding finger. A bit uneasy around blood herself.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Umm, yes, thank you.</div>
<div class='Character'>YOUNG WOMAN</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Dizzy?</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe plays around with the pocket tissue.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>No, it's fine - don't - it'll pass.</div>

<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Okay, thank you very much.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Thanks and you too.</div>

<div class='Slugline'>INT./EXT. MODERN BULLET TRAIN - DAY</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe wakes up again. She's a lot better now. The speakers in the train announce:</div>
<div class='Character'>operating system (V.O.)</div>
<div class='Paren'>(in Korean)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>...and ATS1 connections to Pyeongyang and Seoul.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe stands up and takes her suitcase from the overhead as the speakers continue:</div>
<div class='Character'>OPERATING SYSTEM (V.O.)</div>
<div class='Paren'>(in English)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>We'll shortly be arriving in Sangseunghan, make sure to bring all your belongings. Connections include Lineweb services to all parts of the city.</div>

<div class='Slugline'>INT. GyemYEONG OFFICE - DAY</div>
<div class='Action'><span style='font-style: italic;'>GYEMYEONG</span>, the commandment of Sangseunghan. A view out of the panoramic window reveals that this office is inside the central symmetric prismatoids.</div>
<div class='Action'>The room is spacious, modern and very welcoming. The floor acts as a screen and shows the city layout: the six city centres around the lake and the Gyemyeong towers. Nothing else.</div>
<div class='Action'>Various architectural tools are there, but most of the architecture is done through computers. Workstations designed for professionals.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe sits at her spacious desk; eyes glued to the computer screen.</div>
<div class='Action'>SLOW MONTAGE:</div>
<div class='Action'>In the software, Phoebe moulds a structure. Starting with a strong octagonal concrete core. She adds supports on the sides to hold the concrete core from all directions; going away from the core to the sides in an angle.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>4.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Action'>On the top of the core Phoebe, who loves every second of this, adds supports outwards, like branches reaching away from a tree.</div>
<div class='Action'>Now Phoebe surrounds these concrete structures with a polygon mesh and slowly the concrete structures appear to take the shape of a tree. Finally, Phoebe concludes the polygon tree. She leans back. Proud.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>EXT. SANGSEUNGHAN - SUNSET</div>
<div class='Action'>The city is alive, but slowly going to sleep.</div>
<div class='Action'>END MONTAGE</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. GYEMYEONG Reception - NIGHT</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe sits in the lobby of this modern building. Someone comes up to her: DAE-JUNG (22); smart dude.</div>
<div class='Character'>Dae-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Phoebe? I'm Dae-Jung, I'll just take you -</div>
<div class='Character'>PhoEBE</div>
<div class='Paren'>(understanding)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah.</div>
<div class='Action'>They walk towards a lift, an awkward moment: Two quiet people who don't know each other. They enter the lift and Dae-Jung selects a floor high up.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>So why do you work at night, it seems like a strange choice.</div>
<div class='Character'>Dae-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I love the tranquility of the night.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Alright.</div>
<div class='Action'>Silence.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Oh, uh, I've seen your application material, nice stuff. I look forward to seeing more of it.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>5.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Thank you. You're not doing so bad yourself.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>If you're talking about my Best Transport award, I can hardly take credit for it. I didn't invent the system.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You keep it running nonetheless.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I just plan the structure.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Which is crucial.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Well, thank you.</div>
<div class='Action'>A beat. The lift arrives. Both leave into an office space of normal size, freshly-built, shares the building's aesthetic. A table projects a plasma hologram of the city's contours into the air above it. </div>
<div class='Action'>Various architectural tools are there, but most of the architecture is done through computers. Workstations designed for professionals.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Did Mr Bak fill you in on the specifics?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Not really.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>So basically today you have time to get used to this stuff and tomorrow we start working on the Saeloun Saebyeog expansion project.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe walks off towards the computers.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. HALLWAY - no time indication</div>
<div class='Action'>The Young Woman from the train crosses the hallway, she has a warm and open-minded voice. Phoebe appears from the hallway.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Sure.</div>

<div class='Action'>Tessa and Phoebe sit at a table drinking coffee and tea.</div>
<div class='Character'>TeSSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Fun fact about you, shoot.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe has to think. Somehow, her fascination with blood comes to mind.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>This is kind of boring, but I tend to faint at the sight of blood.</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Oh really? Example?</div>

<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (V.O.) (CONT'D)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I was seven.</div>
<div class='Paren'>(cold)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>A splitter cut into my shoulder. I looked at it and went unconscious instantaneously.</div>
<div class='Action'>Young Phoebe (7) on a car seat. A glass shrapnel rammed into her shoulder. Very bloody. She looks at it and goes unconscious.</div>

<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>God, that must've hurt. What happened?</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>7.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Slugline'>EXT. Road - Night</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (V.O.)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I sat in a car. Another crashed into the side.</div>
<div class='Action'>A Father drives quickly through the night. Instantly from the side: A CAR. Smashing into the rear door. With a massive crash, the metal collides and bends into each other.</div>
<div class='Action'>BACK TO SCENE</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Oh my god, I'm so sorry that happened to you. </div>
<div class='Paren'>(shocked)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Was everyone okay?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Paren'>(hurtful)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I came out with only a scar. </div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe moves her hand towards her shoulder and moves the shirt aside to reveal her well-healed scar.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (CONT'D)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>But my friend - Mi-Ja - didn't make it.</div>
<div class='Action'>Tessa is speechless: how could the world take such a young life.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm sorry, that was sad.</div>
<div class='Character'>TeSSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm glad I never had to go through that.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Paren'>(with air quotations)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>So what's your 'fun' fact?</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I wanted to do medicine, but blood makes me nauseous too, so I went for robotics management. They only bleed oil at most.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. GYEMYEONG OFFICE - DAY</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe happily strolls into the room and sits down at her desk. Work proceeds on the tree from yesterday.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>8.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Action'>SLOW MONTAGE:</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe runs an optimisation program, which adjusts the materials and proportions of certain parts. She then analyses the air resistance properties of the building and adds a suspended mass damper (a weight to balance buildings).</div>
<div class='Action'>Earthquake tests show some weak spots, which Phoebe fixes by adding more support. Structural integrity reports show the building to be safe for earthquake levels up to 8.5.</div>
<div class='Action'>END MONTAGE</div>
<div class='Slugline'>EXT. SANGSEUNGHAN - NIGHT</div>
<div class='Action'>In the night the city's lights shine light bluish. </div>
<div class='Action'>The traffic of the <span style='font-style: italic;'>LINEWEB</span> system flows; a web of magnetic levitation tracks connecting all places in Sangseunghan, full of self-driving, mostly single-person cars. These tracks are only visible through spacious gaps in the pavement.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. GYEMYEONG OFFICE - NIGHT</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe sits at her desk, eyes on the screen. She designs a simple cuboid-building.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>May I take a look at that?</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung approaches her screen.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Rather not.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Come on, we're supposed to design this district together.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yes, but you've got to cooperate with me. Not the other way around.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Paren'>(annoyed)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah.</div>
<div class='Action'>Ignoring her, he analyses plans for the building. A lot of flats are compressed inside the building, very efficient, though also cramped, in his view: claustrophobic.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>9.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Right here you got about 400 flats.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Four hundred and ninety, yes.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>490 and most of them don't even have windows, imagine the isolation. How about we put some social spaces in the centre?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Or we could just not do that and save time, effort and cost.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You don't care, do you?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Paren'>(speaking to herself)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Not for this world.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>What?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I can't explain that to you.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Why not?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I just can't.</div>
<div class='Action'>She thinks about it but agrees with what she said.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Anyway, are you done judging me?</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Whatever.</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung leaves for his own desk.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. GYEMYEONG OFFICE, lift - NIGHT</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Great, I'll be on my way.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>EXT. SANGSEUNGHAN - NIGHT</div>
<div class='Action'>At night the city seems dull and lonely. Phoebe travels the lineweb in her car.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. DOORWAY TO MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT</div>
<div class='Action'>A door blocks Phoebe, a scanner displays: 'Request Access'. She presses it.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - NIGHT</div>
<div class='Action'>High speed and high precision machinery produce medical capsules. Amidst the machines filling the hall strolls Tessa. </div>
<div class='Action'>BING, a notification. Tessa heads towards a desk, she sees Phoebe's access-request on the administrating-computer and allows her in.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe comes through the door and observes the metal constructions manufacturing. She's never seen a place like this. Tessa appears and greets her with a hug.</div>
<div class='Action'>Tessa shows Phoebe the fully-automated production line, they're at the packaging machines, capsules are put into a packaging reading 'Numate4b'. Phoebe shows interest, but actually has something else in mind.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>So how are you doing?</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Good. You?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Okay, well - my coworker is stressing me out.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>You're giving him too much control over your life. Let's play something.</div>
<div class='Action'>Tessa takes her phone out of her pocket and starts a card game.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I don't want to play a game now, I want to talk with you about this.</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Sorry, but I just don't want to right now.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Okay, not then.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe leaves. The door behind her closes.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. PHOEBE'S FLAT, BEDROOM - MORNING</div>
<div class='Action'>This is clearly the flat of a minimalist, but it's neatly decorated by paintings showing nature and neo-futurist architecture in symbiosis. The panoramic window faces north and shows Sangseunghan in its beauty. Across the lake, the city glows in the rising sun.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe wakes up. Sweating. She scans the room and it calms her down, her breathing becomes slower. She gets up.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. PHOEBE'S FLAT, LIVING ROOM - MORNING</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe approaches the front door, dressed and ready to go.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. TESSA'S FLAT, LIVING ROOM - DAY</div>
<div class='Action'>A cosy place. Tessa and Phoebe have a friendly conversation.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>They're not really like nightmares, it's more like living a second life.</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>A parallel world?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Kind of, it's like reality but -annoying.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>That's so strange...</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Right?</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>So the dreams are coherent?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah, since I got here they've just been progressing.</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I've never heard of that.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>It's probably some disorder.</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm actually really curious now, would you mind me researching?</div>

<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That's what I've been thinking about your dreams as well.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That they're about the future?</div>
<div class='Character'>TESSA</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yes. This parallel world is like a bad version of your life, right?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>When someone did something wrong, then I've always loved to figure them out instead of hating on their behaviour.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I try to do that too.</div>
<div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Often people are just on the wrong track, make mistakes, without being aware. </div>
<div class='Paren'>(pause)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>And I think it's wonderful that you're aware and willing to improve.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Thanks.</div>
<div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I've been curious and checked out your earlier plans and they're really beautiful. They are so playful and hopeful.</div>

<hr><div class='page_num'>31.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>

<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>When I came here I was so overwhelmed, I had to choose. And let some things come short.</div>
<div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>
<div class='Paren'>(confused)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Hm, okay.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>How did you end up here?</div>
<div class='Action'>Seong-Yeong readjusts her position, opens up. She digs through her memory. She feels so real to Phoebe.</div>
<div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I've not really been interested in grammar and science. I've found my interest in people. That showed in my grades. I've dropped out of school and my parents made every effort to make me feel worthless. A friend helped me make the move away from home. He told me about this job. It was too intriguing.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That sounds painful.</div>
<div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Oh, believe me, it was, but I'm getting better.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe knows that Seong-Yeong isn't real, but she feels real. She decides to not suppress the feeling.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That's nice to hear. I'm here for you if there's something you want to talk about.</div>

<div class='Action'>Phoebe realises the pain she will cause Seong-Yeong and many others. Tears appear in Phoebe's eyes.</div>
<div class='Action'>Seong Yeong invites Phoebe for a hug, which she very much takes in. Someone is there for her, this is someone she can share her pain with.</div>
<div class='Action'>She breathes out in relief.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Understood.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Good. </div>
<div class='Dialog'>I want to discuss how to deal with Miss Yeon's insufficient performance. Whether we can find a solution or if she'll have to be suspended.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>So I'd like to hear your side first Mr Sun.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Very well. Mr Bak, we both know Miss Yeon's application, but in recent plans, we have seen that she cannot live up to those standards.</div>
<div class='Action'>Mr Bak nods.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>The buildings have exactly the same problem as with the current Saeloun Saebyeog buildings. Prioritising human mass storage for joyful living spaces.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>

<hr><div class='page_num'>34.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yes, we have to expand. But we need to create spaces worth living in. These desolate buildings in Saeloun Saebyeog are just harmful.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Furthermore, it's harmful to the government's public image.</div>
<div class='Action'>A beat. Mr Bak turns to Phoebe.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Dialog'>What do you have to say to your defence, Miss Yeon?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I know I've been sloppy, my performance has been way off. But I'm currently working towards achieving my standards.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>But you're nowhere near it.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Dialog'>The most recent plan was not very convincing, I have to agree.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Please, Mr Bak, I would love to continue my service and want to ask for one last chance to turn things around.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Paren'>(investigative)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>And why should we believe that you will change things?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm dealing with a lot of things right now and would love to get a bit of support. Nothing big, just some time to fix things.</div>
<div class='Action'>Mr Bak considers this.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>35.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Paren'>(harsh)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That's hardly an argument Phoebe, considering how many people count on us.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Fair and pleasant, Mr Sun.</div>
<div class='Action'>Mr Bak thinks, glances at Dae-Jung, then at Phoebe, sees her hopeful face.</div>
<div class='Character'>MR BAK</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I want you both to go see Saeloun Saebyeog with your own eyes. Together you'll come up with a plan for major improvements.</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung sighs, but Phoebe has a shimmer of hope in her face.</div>

<div class='Action'>Seong-Yeong snickers mildly at the compliment.</div>
<div class='Character'>SEONG-YEONG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>My point was that maybe that's what you need: A fresh start, a leap in the dark.</div>
<div class='Action'>A different leap in the dark is on Phoebe's mind.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That's very encouraging. Thank you.</div>
<div class='Action'>Seong-Yeong takes Phoebe into her arms. Phoebe enjoys the warmth, Seong-Yeong means a lot to her. And Seong-Yeong enjoys giving Phoebe this support.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>I'm analysing.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Right.</div>
<div class='Action'>A beat. Phoebe loses herself in thoughts again.</div>
<div class='Character'>DaE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Let's talk about ideas then.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Okay.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe stops to explain, Dae-Jung stops as well.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (cONT'D)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>These buildings are too close and high to let sunlight into the streets.</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung listens, nods.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (cONT'D)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>So we could bounce this light in by covering the buildings with glass surfaces.</div>
<div class='Action'>A glass surface appears with square glass panes covering the buildings. This is her imagination.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>But with hexagon panes, </div>
<div class='Action'>Glass panes change to hexagons.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (cONT'D)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>so it doesn't look too much like 20's architecture.</div>
<div class='Character'>DaE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That's good, the honeycomb-style could give it a unique feel.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>That's what I was thinking, but it wouldn't solve the dark streets at night. </div>

<div class='Dialog'>You're thinking it might feel too artificial?</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yeah, like a giant outdoor hospital.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Mh, makes sense.</div>
<div class='Paren'>(a beat)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I think what could also help is some vegetation, trees,</div>
<div class='Action'>Trees appear.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE (coNT'D)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>maybe a little less geometric, placing them randomly.</div>
<div class='Action'>Trees rearrange.</div>
<div class='Character'>Dae-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>And different kinds.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe agrees. Trees transform into different kinds.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Now there's only one more issue.</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung gives a sceptical look.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>The grey walls. We should get some colour on them. Don't you think?</div>
<div class='Action'>The buildings catch joyful colours.</div>

<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG (CoNT'D)</div>

<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I am trying to save these people. Giving them something beautiful.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>And beauty is supposed to save them?</div>
<div class='Paren'>(sighs)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You're just so naive.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Said the infrastructurist.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'd rather put it as "Said the assistant of someone who is about to be fired."</div>

<div class='Dialog'>At least I have the creative capabilities to be an architect.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>You should be careful using the word creative.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>At least I can plan things that are more than rationally practical.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Your looks don't reflect that.</div>
<div class='Action'>Did he just? Phoebe is a bit baffled and insulted.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Look at you -</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Trying to claim the moral high-ground while being such a dick.</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung goes quiet. They walk in silence for a bit.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Sorry. I might not be very creative. And I wish I was, but at least I am good at what I'm doing. I don't mean to insult. But I think you shouldn't be an architect.</div>
<div class='Action'>They turn around a corner.</div>
<div class='Action'>In front of them...</div>
<div class='Action'>towering tall...</div>
<div class='Action'>and bleak...</div>
<div class='Action'>...PHOEBE'S CUBOID BUILDING - almost finished constructing. </div>
<div class='Action'>Bleak plain walls tower into the sky. Nine stories tall. The largest building in Saeloun Saebyeog, yet somehow even less unique than the others.</div>
<div class='Character'>DaE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Here we are, your building. Do you see what I mean?</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe's face shows disappointment. She wishes she could blame someone, but it's her fault.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>46.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Paren'>(cold)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Yes.</div>
<div class='Action'>Dae-Jung keeps walking towards the building. His eyes wander as he speaks his thoughts.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I feel sorry for the people living here. Drawn here by the idea that living in Saeloun is a price worth to be paid. And not really realising how their surroundings slowly take their happiness away. It sounds trivial, but hope is something that makes our life worth living. The belief in a future which satisfies us. This place makes you lose it.</div>
<div class='Action'>In the distance, someone WAILS in pain. Dae-Jung turns around.</div>
<div class='Action'>IT'S PHOEBE!</div>
<div class='Action'>He drops his umbrella and runs towards her. She slowly breaks down to the ground. Now he sees it: her forearm is bleeding. Massively.</div>
<div class='Action'>She has slit her artery. She lies on the ground as the rain blends blood and water on the ground. Her sharp kitchen utensil lies beside her.</div>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe's head lifelessly tilts to the side and her consciousness SLOWLY FADES TO BLACK.</div>
<hr><div class='page_num'>47.</div><div style='margin-bottom: 2em;'></div><div class='Slugline'>INT. PHOEBE'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - 2033</div>
<div class='Action'>YOUNG PHOEBE (8) lies in bed, long brown hair spread out. Korean eyes filled with tears; sad and angry at the world.</div>
<div class='Action'>No like-minded people within her reach.</div>
<div class='Action'>She gets up, wipes her eyes and goes towards her computer. Crosses her modern, elegant room and sits down to see a video.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>ON SCREEN: EXT. SANGSEUNGHAN - DAY, 2033 / PARTIALLY ANIMATED</div>
<div class='Action'>A documentary shows computer-renderings and construction videos of the city Sangseunghan.</div>
<div class='Action'>TEXT ON SCREEN: <span style='font-weight: bold;'>READY TO INHABIT IN 2044</span></div>
<div class='Action'>Six city centres aligned in a hexagon. Crystalline, prismatic and shard-like skyscrapers reflect the warmth of sunlight through glass windows.</div>
<div class='Action'>In the middle of this hexagon lies a round lake. A peninsula in the south hosts two even larger, symmetric prismatoid buildings.</div>
<div class='Action'>City and lake are divided through a naturalistic forest</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. PHOEBE'S CHILDHOOD BEDROOM - 2033</div>
<div class='Action'>Young Phoebe wants to live there. She turns off her computer and lies down in her bed, closing her eyes to think of something else:</div>
<div class='Slugline'>EXT. PPALGAN PEDESTRIAN PAVEMENT - MORNING</div>
<div class='Action'>Young Phoebe strolls and admires the surrounding: Ppalgan one of the six centres, the centre of offices. </div>
<div class='Action'>Paved cobblestone. Trees on a lawn left and right. Young Phoebe notices a gap in the pavement where the lineweb flows.</div>
<div class='Action'>She approaches the end of the pavement.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. LinEWEB STATION, Yeon-An Park - Morning</div>
<div class='Action'>Yeon-An Park can be seen through glass walls. Escalators lead down to it. Young Phoebe takes the escalators, surrounded by people. Admiring the life around her. She wanders off into the park.</div>

<div class='Action'>Broad-leaf trees create shade with a few spots of sunlight, all kinds of people fancy this place, so does Young Phoebe walking by as she admires people reading, picnicking and doing sports.</div>
<div class='Slugline'>EXT. Beautiful Garden, YEON-AN PARK - Day</div>
<div class='Action'>Young Phoebe enters a beautiful garden, vibrant with colours through flowers and blossoms. The garden is closed off from the park by hedges. She traverses it slowly, calmly.</div>

<div class='Action'>Phoebe struggles to open her eyes, but manages to. Dae-Jung sits next to her in a shirt, wet from the rain. His jacket is wrapped around her arm.</div>
<div class='Action'>He's trying to stop the bleeding, though blood keeps escaping. Phoebe attempts to stop it, but she can't.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Ambulance.</div>
<div class='Action'>With a few taps, Dae-Jung requests an ambulance on his phone and puts it away.</div>
<div class='Character'>DaE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Paren'>(softly)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm sorry.</div>
<div class='Action'>She's getting used to the pain and is gaining more power over her body.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Why?</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I shouldn't have put pressure on you, I victimised you.</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I would've done the same if I was you.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>But it was wrong.</div>

<div class='Paren'>(calm)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Don't worry, I'm here for you.</div>

<div class='Action'>FADE TO WHITE</div>
<div class='Slugline'>INT. Hospital Room - Dawn</div>
<div class='Action'>A very bright and bleak room. Phoebe lies in the hospital bed. She awakes from narcosis. She looks to the side. Dae-Jung of all people.</div>
<div class='Character'>DaE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Good morning. Are you feeling better?</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I feel great. Alive even.</div>
<div class='Paren'>(pause)</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Finally seeing the world as it is, not as I dream it to be.</div>
<div class='Action'>A slight smile can be read from her face.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I'm so happy for you. They put you into narcosis right away and started rebuilding your veins and arteries. Now it's only your skin which has to grow back together.</div>

<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>
<div class='Dialog'>I do agree with what you said tonight, we have to do so much better for the people here. Let's not patch up what's broken, let's build something new for the people in Saeloun.</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Maybe.</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Can you -</div>
<div class='Dialog'>How do I ask this? -</div>
<div class='Character'>PHOEBE</div>

<div class='Dialog'>Delusion, but I'll tell you another time.</div>
<div class='Character'>DAE-JUNG</div>
<div class='Dialog'>Okay. I'll ask Mr Bak for some more time to come up with some prototypes.</div>

<div class='Slugline'>Ext. PAVEMENT, SAELOUN SAEBYEOG - Morning</div>
