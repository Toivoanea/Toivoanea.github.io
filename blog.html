<div class='Slugline'>Please Wash Your Hands (January 2020)</div>
<div class='Action'>Would you wash those hands mister? Was not the only strange stuff I put on the clapper board. While mostly I was a gaffer on this film I really enjoyed doing the slate. I think the script has a great concept and I enjoyed giving it this disgusting clinical ugly look of fluorescent meets swimming pool chlorine. Even though a simple lighting setup I'm very satisfied with the look. It's got a unique texture to it that I think fits the piece really well.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>440 Nanometers (January 2020)</div>
<div class='Action'>440 Nanometers was a major passion project, the project started as a concept as my projects usually did but when I found out what theme it's about I found such an emotional connection to it and the main character. The script definitely has lots of flaws, but this again is a project where I just love it for what I was trying to do and I'm majourly proud of it. I don't know if it'll move other people, but it certainly moved me. I think it's a project that's certainly interesting, because it has such a demand for good and unique cinematography, strong lighting and solid sound and sound design. I'm very happy with the soundtrack and the way it was executed. This project had a lot of ambition and I think what we achieved mostly did it justice. Though this time for real: I will never be a producer ever again.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Legally Blonde (ICTheatre Production) (November 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>Together with an ex-alumni sound recordist I filmed ICTheatre's 'Legally Blonde' production on four cameras and edited it as well. This editing project took about 30 hours and they were very long 30 hours, they almost felt as long as when I synced up typing sounds for bootPhoses. But it was paid and genuinely fun at times. Live filming is something quite exciting and it's growing on me, but it's also pretty scary.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Happiness (October 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>This very much felt like I was doing a Wired Autocomplete interview or something. But I gave it my all to light it in an interesting, beautiful but non-distracting way. And if there weren't some planning issues from other departments I would be very proud of the result, yet as it is I've learned that you have to plan and triple check with people and then check yourself again so that some people don't do things that ruin your plans. Despite all that it was a fun project and now I feel confident doing interview and studio setups.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>Closed (October 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>Closed was a short made to test a concept. The question I wanted to answer was: can you tell the story of a blind person through shallow focus, strange shots, cutaways and close ups to bring the audience into their perspective and not be distracted by the technical cinematography. The answer was yes, and that's what greenlit '440 Nanometers' in my head (though I was kind of making it already anyway). I filmed this with my friend Noel and it was good to make a low stakes test shoot mini project.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Sangseunghan (August 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>At the time of writing Sangseunghan I was still a very massive optimist, so the goal of Sangseunghan was to play with the concepts of utopia and dystopia, but more so on how to build a better world without being absolutely utopian. Outlining on Sangseunghan was insanely precise. The index cards were highly detailed and therefore the writing of the actual script didn't take as long, therefore outlining took up a lot of time though. With Sangseunghan I also wanted to force myself into a dialogue heavy script, which is in my opinion the scripts downfall. I really wanted to improve my dialogue writing and I think through the script I definitely did, yet that doesn't mean that the dialogue in it is any good. I think there are a few scenes and concepts I quite like, yet finishing the first draft was disappointing, as I realised that imagination and reality for this script were very far apart, and that I wrote something that I'd find utterly boring to watch as the character is way too passive and all conflict is dialogue, and not the great kind.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Internship at Noah Media Group (July 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>Commuting to London for two weeks to 'work' at a production company was a very new experience. I had a great time with a great team. I've got to see so many facettes of the professional world. Especially the way content is produced in teams and checked off was very interesting. I've never seen so much actual collaboration and it was great. Even though it was only a pre-selection I still find it exciting that in the Tokyo 2020 Olympia there will be clips that I can say "I shortlisted this", it's here because of me. Being at a cinema release at Picturehouse Central was also exciting. I've met England's best cricket players and I barely knew their names, it felt almost unfair to actual fans. I also played around with some of the equipment on a live E-Sport show for F1. The broadcasting room and behind the scenes on the stage was really exciting and cool to have seen. Now every Live broadcast I think about all the people making it work.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>The Passing (June to November 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>Pascal Bauer approached me to co-write this project with me and it was strange. Our writing processes are very different, I'm a heavy outliner and he just has ideas and they're just good. We made it work, I could use frameworks to analyse why things didn't work and fill in things, help edit and come up with bringing it all together thematically and structurally. Ultimately it was a nice collaboration. I've also helped out with the filming of it in various ways.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>*boot(&quot;PHOSES&quot;); (May 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>The script for this story was a major rewrite of something very different. The rewrite started with "What if this was Sci-Fi". And very quickly triggered even more synapses that said yes I find this topical and fascinating. I wanted to inspire more conversation about robots and consciousness and love in our ever growing lonely world of the internet. Looking back it could've been better written and executed in various ways, but I hope it can still be seen for what it wants to be. I remember being very stressed out about producing this myself, and that's where I promised to my mental health to never produce again. And of course that promise has been broken. Sorry mental health.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Swanmeat - Fermented Sugar (April 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>I'm always unsure about this project. The lighting is very far off from what I originally planned. The brief gave me very limited options and space and I'm still not very sure of whether I like it or not. There were so many plans and different approaches to the style of our original project that unfortunately have been discarded, though through the experiments and research I learned a lot.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>Justice (March 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>I felt quite honoured when I was hired as a gaffer on this graduation film. The film and filming offered many challenges and I think I've never learned so much about crews and working with limited and difficult situations than on this production. Nonetheless Justice was fun to shoot and it's certainly far from my best work, but I'm proud of what I achieved back then, especially in terms of achieving good lighting continuity and a coherent style.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>House Invasion (January 2019)</div>
<div class='Action'>I had a great time planning and storyboarding the cinematography of this short film. Unfortunately there were some issues on the production day and the material didn't turn out how we wanted it at all. Therefore nobody could be found to do an edit for it and that's where the project sleeps until today. I've made some creative decisions that even today I'm still curious how they would've turned out had they been executed and then edited.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Season's Reunion (December 2018)</div>
<div class='Action'>The script for this was started a week before filming and all arrangements were made by the film school. It was an amazing first experience directing and getting things made by a crew. There were some requirements for the script by the school, but I feel like I made it my own by creating characters and I still like how their conflict plays out. I just tend to tune it out before the end because the fake-proposal was very out of character.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>FSJ Abschlussseminar (July 2018)</div>
<div class='Action'>During this group trip to Lake Garda in Italy I decided to make a travel blog, initially planned with narration. Again filmed on a phone and sometimes over-graded in the edit. I wanted to capture my experience of it, hoped to capture it for the others as well, and I love looking back at it. I discovered that I really have a love for landscape videography.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Syeh's Exile (May 2018)</div>
<div class='Action'>Syeh's Exile was more or less my first finished narrative video. At this naive early stage I had a lot of fun coming up with all the lore and storyboards. I also got to play around a lot with editing and colour grading. The film had a lot of musical influences that I shared with my soundtrack friend. Syeh's Exile was when I started reading up on film a lot, but it comes from this innocent time of just barely knowing some basics. Looking back I can still enjoy what I was trying to do.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Holding Still (April 2018)</div>
<div class='Action'>This love letter to Iceland was again a strange script journey as I learned frameworks that I applied during the writing. This was the first script that I spent a good amount of time outlining. Notte is also the first character I wrote that I really felt and admired. The dialogue is terrible and some things in it are really cringy, yet I still feel the story has something sweet and naive about it, since that's really how I would describe Notte. The script is very alive in my head and I wish I could have it filmed, just to see how it works. I want it to be as beautiful as I picture it.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Infiltration (December 2017)</div>
<div class='Action'>Unfortunately the script idea that got me into screenwriting collapsed under its scope too quickly, therefore my first completed screenplay was Infiltration. During the writing of Infiltration I started learning about a few screenwriting frameworks, which gradually were applied to the story. At the time I had a hard time finding out what worked and what didn't work and rewriting was short and difficult.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>Lahr - A Hometown (December 2017)</div>
<div class='Action'>I never appreciated my hometown until a few months before leaving it. In an attempt to capture what it means to me I decided to do a brief story-of-my-life video about it. I often think about geography so I decided to do it via a map and images through 'green screened' cards coming in and out. Due to it all being filmed one handed on a phone the quality is questionable and keyframing took me two weeks, yet I still look at this project with a smile.<div class='Action'>
