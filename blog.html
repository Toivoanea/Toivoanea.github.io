<div class='Slugline'>21/07/2018 FSJ Abschlussseminar am Gardasee</div>
<div class='Action'>When I thought of a last video project that I could do before film school I quickly concluded to do another travel video, as I knew I was going to Lake Garda soon.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>So I did that as a way of remembering it. I first planned on doing a commentated video but then switched to pure landscape and music, so it also works as a way of presenting these journeys that are part of the voluntary service that I'm doing.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>I love doing these travel videos as they work wonderfully to capture the emotions and thoughts I had.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>31/05/2018 Site Restructuring</div>
<div class='Action'>The website's home page now shows screenplays and videos, that way there's a better timeline for both kinds of projects.<div class='Action'>
		
<div class='Slugline'>17/05/2018 Syeh’s Exile (Short Film // Music by _RAVEN)</div>
<div class='Action'>My question of what I could film before moving to the UK lead to this project. Me, an idea and without any help. The idea quickly came to me of doing a music video with a song produced solely for this and I think it turned out quite nicely; of course with imperfections; I'm learning. &gt;<a href="http://vimeo.com/toivoa/Syeh">Here</a>&lt; it is.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>06/04/2018 Holding Still Update #12</div>
<div class='Action'>I did some additional polish and some minor changes and I will now consider the screenplay as finished.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>30/03/2018 Holding Still Update #11</div>
<div class='Action'>What was previously known as Ljósálfar now has a proper title: "Holding Still".<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Major addition: ACT II has been completed, finally. Now the screenplay is gapless.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>'Return' has been compacted and refined. 'Elven cave' as well, I've also added memory loss as a way of having consequences in her action. I personally think it feels fitting in a story about moments, to have moments lost. It's not too sad either as they can make new ones. Basically everything got its tweaks.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Smilla has been renamed to Felinne, for personal reasons and because of the way it sounds and what effect it might have, also because "Notte and Smilla" sounded weird as a couple to me, so I wanted to change that.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Felinne and Notte's ages have been changed to 19 to make Felinne's story believable, therefore they are now students.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>24/02/2018 London 2018 travel video blog</div>
<div class='Action'>I made some planning progress for Changing Moments, but nothing to show yet. I did though go to London and Brighton for my application at the Brighton Film School (where I will be studying, starting September 2018). For this journey I produced a little video blog, which can be found &gt;<a href="http://vimeo.com/toivoa/London2018">here</a>&lt;.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>04/02/2018 Holding Still Update #10</div>
<div class='Action'>I improved a lot of the lines, especially in "Out of Time".<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>03/02/2018 Compatibility increased for mobile</div>
<div class='Action'>While still a nightmare the mobile portrait version of the page has been improved. You can now use the website on your smartphone without a magnifying glass. I still recommend landscape.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>29/01/2018 The Change Blog has been created.</div>
<div class='Action'>This page will give information on updates happening on my github page. This page will mainly document the changes happening to the screenplays, so that there is an overview of what's new and if there's something interesting or just minor improvement.<div class='Action'>
