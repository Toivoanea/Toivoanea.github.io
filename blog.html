<div class='Slugline'>14/06/2019 Archive Page</div>
<div class='Action'>Sometimes I work on things that I'm not proud of posting. This can be because I didn't contribute enough, because I don't think I did a good job, or because I am not happy having my name attached to this for ethically problematic content (which I want to avoid working on as much as possible).<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>For this reason I created a <a href="https://toivoanea.github.io/archive.html">list</a> of projects I have worked on, mostly for creating a complete overview and sharing with potential employers. I am yet unsure whether to embed it into the website.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>07/04/2019 Sangseunghan - First Draft</div>
<div class='Action'>Holding Still had its anniversary on the 6th of April. The day after its release I started working on Sangseunghan, thereby marking the 7th as the anniversary of its inception. Now, exactly a year later, I can present the First Draft. This first draft is already a reworked version of the original outline, though from now on I want to collect feedback from others and conclude what worked, what I can improve and what things I will have to consider for future screenplays. <div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Sangseunghan developed out of a simple showerthought: A story about a person who has dreams and nightmares that parallel each other greatly. Fairly quickly this concept grew with the themes of utopia and dystopia.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>I knew that for this project I wanted to "dream", meaning that I wanted to write it as if I had all the money in the world to make it. Obviously this is a screenplay that due to high visual effects and niche story would be commercially impossible to make, but this was never the goal.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Phoebe as a character came after the concept, which is probably apparent, as to me it sometimes feels like she is a bit too passive to be a good protagonist, as the story is not as character driven. Nonetheless I find her story fascinating and am still proud of it. Initially I wanted to force myself to improve my dialogue writing by having a dialogue heavy story. While I like writing conflict scenes, I have to work on writing stories that require story and character arcs to play out in non-verbal ways.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Sangseunghan is a love letter to Neo-Futurist architecture and those wonderful TED Talks about future city planning, which have greatly inspired more thought and created this setting.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Why Korea? I wanted to go somewhere else. Neo Tokyo has too many iterations and the future western world was not really something I have high hopes for. South Korea is placed that due to its separated culture is mainly overlooked by many. I wanted to imagine a world where the world's governments went away from the thought of countries, and where the Koreas come together with the rest of the world to form an accepting, multicultural place. Sangseunghan is still a very optimistic future, but I wanted to present a positive image of how the future could be, to inspire, rather than scare.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>24/02/2019 thoughts on achieving my dream</div>
<div class='Action'>where do you go when you achived your dreams?<br></br>it sounds like a petty worry of someone happy.<br></br>but does it actually make you happy?<br></br>for a while it's empowering and euphoric<br></br>until you lose that euphoria and you keep telling yourself:<br></br>"you're living the dream, be happy, you've made it"<br></br>you soon come to realise you're lying to yourself<br></br><div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>i'm flawed; the past taught me wrong.<br></br>when life was not worth living i wanted to look back<br></br>but there was nothing to look back at in awe.<br></br>so i learned to live for the future, for hope; toivoa.<br></br><div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>and some day you come to realise,<br></br>that this hope for a better future is foolish.<br></br>the happiness will never last, because we<br></br>get so used to our circumstances.<br></br><div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>but how is it possible to live the moment?<br></br>when you've lived your whole life for the future?<br></br>can i change, or is this rooted inside me?<br></br>should i change to live the day?<br></br>should i keep living the lie?<br></br><div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>i am lost<br></br>the world at my feet,<br></br>but without a clue where to go.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>04/12/2018 Internet People & Sangseunghan</div>
<div class='Action'>Internet People has been a project for film school, which is my first attempt at filming something narratively with proper equipment and crew, kind of. I wanted to share this as part of the timeline of things I did.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Sangseunghan is well on its way with about half of it written. I'm expecting to release a first draft in January.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>31/07/2018 Sangseunghan - the city of projections</div>
<div class='Action'>Now that I'm finished outlining my next screenplay, I want to give a little bit of an insight into my ideas and methods. After constructing the character arcs, the characters and the world, I started planning scenes on little cards specifying what the scenes mean and how they will play out.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>21/07/2018 FSJ Abschlussseminar am Gardasee</div>
<div class='Action'>When I thought of a last video project that I could do before film school I quickly concluded to do another travel video, as I knew I was going to Lake Garda soon.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>So I did that as a way of remembering it. I first planned on doing a commentated video but then switched to pure landscape and music, so it also works as a way of presenting these journeys that are part of the voluntary service that I'm doing.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>I love doing these travel videos as they work wonderfully to capture the emotions and thoughts I had. &gt;<a href="http://vimeo.com/toivoa/garda">Here</a>&lt; it is.<div class='Action'><div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>31/05/2018 Site Restructuring</div>
<div class='Action'>The website's home page now shows screenplays and videos, that way there's a better timeline for both kinds of projects.<div class='Action'>
		
<div class='Slugline'>17/05/2018 Syeh’s Exile (Short Film // Music by _RAVEN)</div>
<div class='Action'>My question of what I could film before moving to the UK lead to this project. Me, an idea and without any help. The idea quickly came to me of doing a music video with a song produced solely for this and I think it turned out quite nicely; of course with imperfections; I'm learning. &gt;<a href="http://vimeo.com/toivoa/Syeh">Here</a>&lt; it is.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>06/04/2018 Holding Still Update #12</div>
<div class='Action'>I did some additional polish and some minor changes and I will now consider the screenplay as finished.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>30/03/2018 Holding Still Update #11</div>
<div class='Action'>What was previously known as Ljósálfar now has a proper title: "Holding Still".<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Major addition: ACT II has been completed, finally. Now the screenplay is gapless.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>'Return' has been compacted and refined. 'Elven cave' as well, I've also added memory loss as a way of having consequences in her action. I personally think it feels fitting in a story about moments, to have moments lost. It's not too sad either as they can make new ones. Basically everything got its tweaks.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Smilla has been renamed to Felinne, for personal reasons and because of the way it sounds and what effect it might have, also because "Notte and Smilla" sounded weird as a couple to me, so I wanted to change that.<div class='Action'>
<div class='Action'>Felinne and Notte's ages have been changed to 19 to make Felinne's story believable, therefore they are now students.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>24/02/2018 London 2018 travel video blog</div>
<div class='Action'>I made some planning progress for Changing Moments, but nothing to show yet. I did though go to London and Brighton for my application at the Brighton Film School (where I will be studying, starting September 2018). For this journey I produced a little video blog, which can be found &gt;<a href="http://vimeo.com/toivoa/London2018">Here</a>&lt;.<div class='Action'>

<div class='Slugline'>04/02/2018 Holding Still Update #10</div>
<div class='Action'>I improved a lot of the lines, especially in "Out of Time".<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>03/02/2018 Compatibility increased for mobile</div>
<div class='Action'>While still a nightmare the mobile portrait version of the page has been improved. You can now use the website on your smartphone without a magnifying glass. I still recommend landscape.<div class='Action'>
	
<div class='Slugline'>29/01/2018 The Change Blog has been created.</div>
<div class='Action'>This page will give information on updates happening on my github page. This page will mainly document the changes happening to the screenplays, so that there is an overview of what's new and if there's something interesting or just minor improvement.<div class='Action'>
